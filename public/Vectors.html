    SVGs are a great way to add character to a site and save page weight at the
    same time. We want to encourage the use of lightweight, minified vector
    files as often as possible.
</p>
<p>In Webflow (or any website) there are two ways to add an SVG image.</p>
<ol>
    <li>As inline code, within an <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> tag</li>
    <li>Linked from your assets, inside an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    In Webflow, only SVG inside an embed can be given the
    <code>fill: currentcolor</code> property, which can be incredibly useful.
    But SVG images are much easier to manage with Webflow&#39;s built in tools,
    and much easier to compress in bulk.
</p>
<p>
    This choice can become confusing, so we&#39;ve written the following
    guidelines to make using SVG more straightforward. We suggest two methods
    for adding SVG.
</p>
<h2 id="svg-embed-strategy">SVG embed strategy</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Add an HTML embed</li>
    <li>Paste SVG code straight from your illustrator clipboard.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Embeds containing SVG will automatically have
    <code>fill: currentcolor</code> applied to them via the global styles embed
    in the GV webflow template.
</p>
<p>Use this method for</p>
<ul>
    <li>Small SVG images, like icons, arrows and social links.</li>
    <li>
        Any SVG where it is necessary to change the color with an interaction,
        or with a mouse event like <code>::hover</code>.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="svg-image-strategy">SVG image strategy</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Upload the SVG to the assets panel, like you would a PNG.</li>
</ol>
<p>Use this method for</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Larger SVG graphics, logos, backgrounds, anything roughly larger than
        10kb.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    As of right now, there&#39;s no good way to compress SVGs added inside
    embeds. Ideally, you should always delete any extraneous XML litter added by
    Illustrator, like <code>data-name=&quot;layer-1&quot;</code> or the
    <code
        >&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;</code
    >
    prologue. The <code>&lt;defs&gt;</code> tag is usually unnecessary; fill
    colors can be assigned inline, i.e.
    <code>&lt;path fill=&quot;#fff&quot;&gt;</code>.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        If your svg has enough colors to require <code>&lt;defs&gt;</code>,
        consider making it an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag instead.
    </p>
